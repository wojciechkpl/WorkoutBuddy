# Weightlifting Program Design Decision Tree

## Step 1: Primary Goal Assessment

### **Strength** (1-5 rep max improvement)
- Focus: Heavy compound movements
- Rep ranges: 1-5 reps
- Rest periods: 3-5 minutes
- Progression: Weight-focused

### **Hypertrophy/Mass** (muscle size)
- Focus: Volume and time under tension
- Rep ranges: 6-12 reps
- Rest periods: 2-3 minutes
- Progression: Weight + volume

### **Muscular Endurance** (high reps, fatigue resistance)
- Focus: Higher volume, shorter rest
- Rep ranges: 12-20+ reps
- Rest periods: 30-90 seconds
- Progression: Volume + density

### **Weight Loss** (fat loss with muscle preservation)
- Focus: Compound movements + metabolic stress
- Rep ranges: 8-15 reps
- Rest periods: 60-90 seconds
- Progression: Circuit training, supersets

## Step 2: Experience Level Assessment

### **Beginner** (0-6 months consistent training)
- **Frequency**: 3 days/week full body OR 2 days/week upper/lower
- **Focus**: Learn movement patterns, build base strength
- **Progression**: Linear progression (add weight weekly)
- **Volume**: 2-3 sets per exercise, 3-4 exercises per session

### **Intermediate** (6 months - 2 years)
- **Frequency**: 3-4 days/week
- **Focus**: Increase training volume and complexity
- **Progression**: Weekly or bi-weekly increases
- **Volume**: 3-4 sets per exercise, 4-6 exercises per session

### **Advanced** (2+ years)
- **Frequency**: 4-6 days/week
- **Focus**: Specialization and periodization
- **Progression**: Monthly blocks, deload weeks
- **Volume**: 4-6 sets per exercise, 6-8 exercises per session

---

## Step 3: Time Commitment Analysis

### **2 Days/Week (45-60 min sessions)**
**Recommended**: Full body or upper/lower split
- **Beginner**: Full body (compound movements only)
- **Intermediate/Advanced**: Upper/lower split
- **Focus**: Compound exercises, minimal isolation

### **3 Days/Week (45-75 min sessions)**
**Recommended**: Full body or push/pull/legs
- **Beginner**: Full body
- **Intermediate**: Full body or PPL
- **Advanced**: PPL or upper/lower/full

### **4 Days/Week (45-60 min sessions)**
**Recommended**: Upper/lower or push/pull/legs/rest
- **All levels**: Upper/lower split works well
- **Intermediate/Advanced**: 4-day PPL variation

### **5-6 Days/Week (45-90 min sessions)**
**Recommended**: Push/pull/legs or body part splits
- **Advanced only**: Allows for specialization
- **Options**: PPL x2, or 5-day body part split

---

## Step 4: Equipment-Based Program Selection

### **Bodyweight Only**
**Best for**: Beginners, endurance goals, travel situations

**Upper Body**: Push-ups (variations), pull-ups, dips, pike push-ups
**Lower Body**: Squats, lunges, single-leg squats, calf raises
**Core**: Planks, mountain climbers, leg raises

**Progression**: Increase reps → harder variations → weighted versions

### **Dumbbells Only**
**Best for**: Home gym, all goals except max strength

**Compound**: Goblet squats, DB deadlifts, DB bench press, DB rows
**Isolation**: Bicep curls, tricep extensions, lateral raises, lunges
**Full body**: DB complexes, circuits

**Progression**: Weight increases, rep increases, tempo changes

### **Barbell + Basic Equipment**
**Best for**: Strength and mass goals, intermediate to advanced

**Core lifts**: Squat, deadlift, bench press, overhead press, rows
**Accessories**: Based on goals and weaknesses
**Setup**: Power rack, bench, barbell, plates

**Progression**: Linear → weekly → block periodization

### **Full Gym Access**
**Best for**: All goals, all levels (most versatile)

**Machines**: Beginner-friendly, isolation work
**Free weights**: Compound movements, functional strength
**Cardio equipment**: Weight loss, endurance goals
**Cables**: Constant tension, joint-friendly

## Program Templates by Goal + Equipment + Time

### **Strength Focus (Barbell, 3-4 days, Intermediate+)**
**Day 1**: Squat focus (squat, bench, row)
**Day 2**: Deadlift focus (deadlift, overhead press, pulldowns)
**Day 3**: Bench focus (bench, squat variation, accessories)
**Optional Day 4**: Overhead press focus + accessories

### **Mass/Hypertrophy (Full gym, 4-5 days, All levels)**
**Day 1**: Chest + Triceps
**Day 2**: Back + Biceps
**Day 3**: Legs + Glutes
**Day 4**: Shoulders + Arms
**Optional Day 5**: Weak points/lagging body parts

### **Weight Loss (Any equipment, 3-4 days, All levels)**
**Format**: Circuit training or supersets
**Day 1**: Upper body circuit
**Day 2**: Lower body + core circuit
**Day 3**: Full body metabolic circuit
**Day 4**: Active recovery or additional circuit

### **Endurance (Bodyweight/Light weights, 3-5 days)**
**Format**: High rep, short rest, circuit style
**Focus**: Compound movements, minimal rest
**Progression**: Increase rounds, decrease rest, add complexity

## Key Decision Points Summary

1. **Start with goal** → determines rep ranges and training style
2. **Assess experience** → determines complexity and volume
3. **Match time availability** → determines split and frequency
4. **Work with equipment** → determines exercise selection
5. **Create progression plan** → ensures continued adaptation

---

## Red Flags & Modifications

**Too ambitious**: Scale back frequency or duration
**Plateau quickly**: Reassess goals and progression scheme
**Pain/discomfort**: Focus on form, reduce load, seek guidance
**Inconsistent schedule**: Choose flexible 2-3 day programs
**Limited recovery**: Increase rest days, focus on sleep/nutrition

---

## Next Steps After Program Selection

1. **Week 1-2**: Focus on form and establishing routine
2. **Week 3-4**: Begin progressive overload
3. **Week 5-8**: Assess progress and make adjustments
4. **Week 9+**: Plan deload weeks or program changes
5. **Monthly**: Reassess goals and modify as needed
